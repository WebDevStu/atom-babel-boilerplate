# Atom Babel Boilerplate

Atom es2015 Babel base project set up, use for setting up a new project using Atom and babel to compile your ES2015 to ECMAscript 5.

Below are the Atom packages that are required for the Babel to run

- **jshint** (<a href="https://atom.io/packages/jshint">https://atom.io/packages/jshint</a>) `apm install jshint` (Not compulsory, but why wouldn't you?)
- **language-babel** (<a href="https://atom.io/packages/language-babel">https://atom.io/packages/language-babel</a>) `apm install language-babel`
- **source-tree** (<a href="https://atom.io/packages/source-preview">https://atom.io/packages/source-preview</a>) `apm install source-preview`

source-tree is optional, you can do cool things with it where it live compiles the jsx your working on into the preview panel.

All this gubbins needs to be in the root of the project you are creating in Atom, if these are in a sub directory of an Atom project, you'll run into error and need to change the config.
